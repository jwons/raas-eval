Table: This table compares the execution results from scripts without RaaS
compared to with RaaS. This table contains only the scripts from
datasets that completed under both conditions. The "With RaaS"
category has fewer total scripts due to RaaS's preprocessing
preventing sourced scripts from executing. A dataset error means at
least one script in a dataset contained an error. {#tbl:pre-post}
